# Driver Issues

### The first driver issue being the `logitech Hidd Device`

The error message :- "logitech-hidpp-device root_get_protocol_version received protocol error 0x08,"

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Update Your System**: Make sure your Ubuntu system is fully updated. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **Install or Reinstall the Required Packages**: Ensure that the necessary packages for Logitech devices are installed and up to date. You can install the `solaar` package, which is a device manager for Logitech's Unifying Receiver peripherals:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install solaar
   ```

3. **Check USB Port and Connection**: Try connecting the device to a different USB port. Sometimes, USB ports can have issues that cause communication errors.

4. **Check for Kernel Issues**: Since HID++ issues can be related to the kernel, make sure you are using a stable and supported kernel version. You can check your current kernel version with:

   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

   If needed, you can update your kernel.

5. **Review System Logs**: Check the system logs for more detailed error messages. This can give you more context on what might be causing the issue. Use the following command to review the logs:

   ```bash
   sudo dmesg | grep logitech
   ```

6. **Restart the HID Service**: Sometimes restarting the HID service can resolve issues. Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe -r hid_logitech_hidpp
   sudo modprobe hid_logitech_hidpp
   ```

7. **Unpair and Repair the Device**: If the device is paired using a Logitech Unifying Receiver, try unpairing and then repairing the device using the `solaar` application or the Logitech software.
